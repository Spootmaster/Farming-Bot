Name - Drew Summers  
Project Name â€“ Farming Bot 

Description of project -  
A farming bot used to control my in-game character in any video game or application. It should be able to see the screen and do what you tell it to do like press w to walk forward or left click to interact. 

Development environment and tools -  
The Development environment will be a VM created just for this with python, my game of choice or application, PyAutoGUI, AutoIt, and OpenCV. These are just the ones I have researched so far. I will update the document if I find more that will be of use. 

 

Function -  
I expect my program to be able to see my screen and use my keyboard and mouse to make movements and click things depending on what you want it to do. 
Essential functions would include keyboard and mouse activation. 
Non-essential functions would include seeing the screen to see what to do. I run down of what it would do it I would tell it to walk forward and left click mouse one time.
